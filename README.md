Simple Ruby client for Nimble API
=================================

Different Ruby clients for Nimble.

**Sample 1**

Simple client for Nimble API using Ruby

Contains future OmniAuth strategy for Nimble OAuth and sample code, using Sinatra framework. 

Doesn't do anything particularly useful, just fetches last contacted info. 

OmniAuth strategy will be updated, as soon as we'll have appropriate methods for getting logged user info. 

**Sample 2**

Another version of simple client, using standard OAuth2 library for all.
